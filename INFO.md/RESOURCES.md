### Opcode NP 0F AE /7 CLFLUSH m8
The availability of CLFLUSH is indicated by the presence of the CPUID feature flag CLFSH (CPUID.01H:EDX[bit 19]). 
Flushes cache line containing m8.Invalidates from every level of the cache hierarchy in the cache coherence domain the cache line that contains the linear address specified with the memory operand. If that cache line contains modified data at any level of the cache hierarchy, that data is written back to memory. The source operand is a byte memory location.
The aligned cache line size affected is also indicated with the CPUID instruction (bits 8 through 15 of the EBX register when the initial value in the EAX register is 1).
